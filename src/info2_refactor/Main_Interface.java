/*Program which contains programs made in the HTW Berlin IMI Bachelor Info 2 course (WiSe 2019/2020). 
 * @konrad-u
 * 
 * Interface for Main Class, which loads and interacts with instances of each lab sessions' program. 
 * 04.03.2020: 
 * 		Idea is to incorporate all programs made throughout semester.
 * 		Main Class here will manage the user interface for accessing each program and creating instances of it. 
 * 		Must be able to do the following things (format is: Method description || Method signature || OPEN QUESTIONS)
 * 		
 * 		- List all Programs || listAllPrograms()
 * 
 * 		- List all Classes used in a program || listAllProgramClasses(String programClasses)
 * 
 * 		- List all methods the class and an object of a class can run || listAllMethods(String programMethods)
 * 
 * 		- Return program description || returnProgramDescription (String programName)
 * 
 * 		- Create objects of a program || createInstance(String programName, String objectName) || 
 * 			with multiple objects created in a program, what will be targeted? Depends on Program and object --> implementation
 * 				with polymorphism?
 * 			new window for each program showing text (lab/program description, methods) and a new console output / user input?
 * 			
 * 
 * 		- Delete object of a program || deleteInstance(String objectName)
 * 
 * 		-
